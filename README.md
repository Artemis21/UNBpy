# UNBpy
A very simple Python wrapper for the [UnbelievaBoat API](https://unbelievaboat.com/api/docs). UnbelievaBoat is a Discord bot, and
this wrapper is designed for use with the discord.py Discord API wrapper, though it doesn't actually depend on it. However, it
does depend on the Python requests module, and Python 3.6+ (f-strings). This may be buggy as I haven't even tested it yet.

This is my first piece of open source code so please excuse the messiness!
